      question: 'Who is this masterclass for?',
      answer: 'CA students looking for articleship opportunities, especially those targeting reputed firms like Big 4, Big 6, top mid-size and consulting firms, as well as students preparing for upcoming articleship drives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is this only for Big 4 aspirants?',
      answer: 'No. The framework is relevant to students targeting Big 4, Big 6, reputed mid-size firms, boutique consulting practices, corporate finance divisions, and other professional organisations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long is the masterclass?',
      answer: 'The masterclass spans 6 intensive days. Each day features structured live sessions, actionable frameworks, and live interactive Q&A.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the fee?',
      answer: '₹999 for the current batch. This is a one-time fee covering all 6 days, downloadable CV templates, cold email scripts, Excel workbooks, and batch WhatsApp group access.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I get a WhatsApp group?',
      answer: 'Yes! Immediately after successful registration and server verification, you will receive the official invite link for your specific batch WhatsApp group where all session links and cohort discussions take place.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are placements guaranteed?',
      answer: 'No. The masterclass provides battle-tested guidance, rigorous preparation, and proven resources, but does not guarantee an articleship offer. Final hiring decisions rest entirely with respective firms and candidate performance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are interviews guaranteed?',
      answer: 'No. Historical student outcomes (such as 100% of tracked students receiving at least one Big 6 interview opportunity) reflect historical cohorts and do not guarantee future interview opportunities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the payment refundable?',
      answer: 'Due to strictly limited cohort seats and immediate allocation of batch resources upon enrollment, registration fees are non-refundable.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I receive a certificate?',
      answer: 'Yes. Students who complete the 6-day curriculum and submit their capstone assignments will receive a digital Certificate of Completion from Umbrella Network.',
